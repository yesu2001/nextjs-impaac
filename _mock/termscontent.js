<h3>Access and use of the services</h3>

<p>Services Description: The Services are offered as a platform (the &ldquo;Platform&rdquo;) to users of the Services, which may include Campaign Organizers (interchangeably used with &ldquo;Champions&rdquo;), Beneficiaries, Recipients and Donors (each defined herein) and other users of the Services (which may include users who interact with the Site or Services). Among other features, the Services are designed to allow a user (a &ldquo;Campaign Organizer&rdquo;) to post a fundraising campaign (&ldquo;Campaign&rdquo;) to the Platform to accept monetary donations (&ldquo;Donations&rdquo;) from those users wishing to contribute funds to the Campaign (&ldquo;Donors&rdquo;). A Campaign Organizer may be both, a Beneficiary and a Recipient, for any Campaign.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;Beneficiary&rdquo; includes an individual, a group of individuals, or any entity that benefits from Donations through a Campaign, and a Recipient. A &ldquo;Recipient&rdquo; includes an individual or entity that is authorised by the Beneficiary through written means to receive Donations on behalf of the Beneficiary. Although there are no fees to set up a Campaign, a percentage of each Donation will be charged as fees for our Services and those of our third party payment processors. Please see our Pricing section for details.</p>

<p>Charitable Giving: Campaigns, unless otherwise clearly stated by Impaac Foundation, are not charities to which you can make tax-deductible charitable contributions. However, in addition to the Services described above, Impaac Foundation permits Donors to contribute to certain charitable organizations (&ldquo;Charities&rdquo;) through the Platform. You understand and acknowledge&nbsp;that Impaac Foundation is not a charity, and Impaac Foundation does not solicit charitable donations for itself or for any third-party charitable institution.&nbsp;You, as a Campaign Organizer, represent and warrant that, you are not a charity as defined in&nbsp;Section 80G of the Income Tax Act 1961, as amended (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;). If you or your charity would like to register to be listed as a charitable organization on the Platform, you can do so at the time of setting up a Campaign. As used in this Agreement, the term &ldquo;Campaign&rdquo; does not refer to a Charity, and you acknowledge that contributions to Campaigns are not deductible for Indian Income Tax deduction, unless your registered charity is authorized to issue tax-exempt certificates under&nbsp;Section 80G.</p>

<p>The Services are a Platform; We are not a Broker, Financial Institution, Creditor or Charitable Institution: The Services are an administrative platform only. Impaac Foundation facilitates the Donation transaction between Champions and Donors, but is not a party to any agreement between a Champion and a Donor, or between any user and a Charity. Impaac Foundation is not a broker, agent, financial institution, creditor or insurer for any user. Impaac Foundation has no control over the conduct of, or any information provided by a Champion or a Charity, and Impaac Foundation hereby disclaims all liability in this regard. Anyone is free to report issues related to a Campaign on Impaac Foundation, and Impaac Foundation will take necessary action to the best of its abilities.</p>

<p>Impaac Foundation does not guarantee that a Campaign or a Charity will obtain a certain amount of Donations or any Donations at all. We do not personally endorse any Campaign, Champion, or Charity, and we make no guarantee, explicit or implied, that any information provided through the Services by a user is accurate. We expressly disclaim any liability or responsibility for the success of any Campaign, or the outcome of any fundraising purpose. You, as a Donor, must make the final determination as to the value and appropriateness of contributing to any Campaign, Champion, or Charity. You can write to us for any clarification, and we shall make our best effort to share the information that we have.</p>

<p>While we try our best to do so, we cannot and do not verify 100% of the information that Champions supply. We try our best to see that Donations are used in accordance with the stated fundraising purpose; we also collect documents related to Campaigns before disbursing Donations or in other cases that Impaac Foundation may determine, at its sole discretion. However, please understand that we can not guarantee that 100% of the time Donations will be used in accordance with any fundraising purpose prescribed by a Champion or Charity. We assume no responsibility to verify whether the Donations are used in accordance with any applicable laws, and such responsibility rests solely with the Champion or Charity, as applicable. While we have no legal obligation to verify that the use of any funds raised is in accordance with applicable law and these Terms of Service, we try to do the verifications for many campaigns and more importantly we take possible fraudulent activity and the misuse of funds raised very seriously. If you have reason to believe that a Champion or Charity is not raising or using the funds for their stated purpose, please use the &ldquo;Report&rdquo; button on the Campaign to alert our team of this potential issue and we will investigate to the best of our abilities.</p>

In most instances, these Borrowers are considered &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; by traditional lenders for a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the Borrowers&rsquo; lack of credit history, the use of the loan proceeds for entrepreneurial endeavors including investment in a &ldquo;start up&rdquo; business, and the geographic location including the risk of financial instability and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.</p>

<p>You may participate as a Lender by creating an online account on the Website registered to your email address. All transactions between Lenders and Borrowers or Field Partners must be conducted through a Impaac Foundation account. The amount of funds you have available in your Impaac Foundation account that you have deposited and is freely available to be lent is referred to as your &ldquo;Impaac Foundation Credit.&rdquo; If you make a Loan (as defined in the next sentence) through the Website, you are instructing Impaac Foundation to apply your Impaac Foundation Credit to fund the specific Loan you have designated on the Website. All Impaac Foundation Credit in your Impaac Foundation account must be lent and repaid to your account before you can withdraw it.

Loans made via the Impaac Foundation are philanthropic in nature with no offered rate of return, subject to foreign exchange fluctuations and, as such, are not intended as, and cannot be considered as, an investment in a financial instrument or security.

<p>In order to comply with local laws and regulations, any loan, in which the user has not logged into the impaac.org system, or has not performed any action on the impaac.org site,&nbsp;for more than 5 years, counted from the time of the closure of the audit, will be recognized as income by IPT Singapore,&nbsp;subsidiary of Impaac Foundation. End of every year Impaac Foundation will work out and Identify outstanding loans, where the lender has not made a login, nor taken any action on impaac.org platform, for the last 5 years.

<p>Fees: Impaac Foundation does not charge a Champion any upfront fees for initiating a Campaign. Impaac Foundation retains a flat percentage of each Donation contributed to a Campaign and all charitable contributions made to a Charity (collectively, &ldquo;Impaac Foundation Platform Fees&rsquo; &lsquo;). An additional payment processing fee is also deducted from each Donation and is payable directly to our third party payment processors (the &ldquo;Payment Processing Fee,&rdquo; and together with the Impaac Foundation Fees, the &ldquo;Fees&rdquo;). In some cases, where the Campaign Organizer has requested, through a written consent, for additional outreach from Impaac Foundation through social media to raise funds, Impaac Foundation shall retain an additional percentage of each Donation contributed to a Campaign from the start of outreach effort towards the costs incurred for such efforts (collectively, &ldquo;Additional Outreach costs&rdquo;) Donors acknowledge that by contributing a Donation to a Campaign, the Donor is agreeing to any and all applicable terms and conditions set forth by a third party payment processor, in addition to these Terms of Service.</p>

<p>Fees are deducted directly from each Donation, and will not be reflected in the amount which a Champion can withdraw from the Campaign or which is directed to a Charity.

<p>Account Holds: From time to time, Impaac Foundation may place a hold on a Campaign account (a &ldquo;Hold&rdquo;) restricting Withdrawals (defined herein) by a Champion. Some of the reasons that we may place a Hold on a Campaign Account include the following: (i) if we have reason to believe (in our sole discretion) that information provided by a Champion is false, misleading, or fraudulent, or that funds are being used in a prohibited manner, (ii) if the funds available should be provided directly to a person other than the Beneficiary (such as a legal beneficiary or person entitled by law to act on behalf of a Beneficiary), (iii) if we have reason to believe that a Campaign or Champion has violated these Terms of Service, (iv) if we think we need additional documentation to have reasonable assurance on utilization of Donations for the purpose stated in the Campaign, or (iv) if required in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, writ, injunction, or as otherwise required under applicable laws and regulations. If you have questions about a Hold we may have placed on your Campaign account, or need information about how to resolve the Hold, please contact us at connect@impaac.org</p>

<p>Withdrawing Donations from a Campaign: Subject to approvals from Impaac Foundation, you, as a Champion (or, as applicable, the beneficiary designated by the Campaign), may withdraw Donations to your Campaign at any time up to the full amount of all Donations credited to your Campaign, less Fees and any previously withdrawn amounts (&ldquo;Withdrawals&rdquo;) and subject to any Holds that we may place on your Campaign account. A Champion may withdraw Donations by electronic wire transfer to the designated bank account or by receipt of a paper check in certain cases. While Impaac Foundation strives to make Withdrawals available to you promptly, you acknowledge and agree Withdrawals may not be available to you for use immediately, and Impaac Foundation does not guarantee that Withdrawals will be available to you within any specific time frame, and Impaac Foundation expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any delay or inability to access and use Withdrawals at any specified time, and any consequences arising from such delay or inability.

<p>Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS</p>

<p>Most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user&rsquo;s satisfaction by emailing Impaac Foundation connect@impaac.org. In the unlikely event that our user support team is unable to resolve a complaint you may have (or if Impaac Foundation has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration, mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Impaac Foundation will pay reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees should you prevail. Impaac Foundation will not seek attorneys&rsquo; fees from you. However, if you initiate an arbitration, the payment of attorneys&rsquo; fees will be governed by the applicable rules (as defined below). Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Arbitration agreement</h3>
<br/>
<p>Impaac Foundation and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</li>
	<li>claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>
	<li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</li>
	<li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Terms of Service.</li>
</ul>

<p>References to &ldquo;Impaac Foundation&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;you&rdquo;, and &ldquo;us&rdquo; include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Impaac Foundation are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Terms of Service.</p>
